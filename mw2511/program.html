               <p>Macdonald polynomials can be introduced as eigenstates of the Macdonald Hamiltonian. This operator coincides with a certain element of the quantum toroidal \(gl(1)\) algebra evaluated in the Fock representation of levels (1,0). Representations of higher levels (r,0) produce generalizations of this Hamiltonian, and their eigenstates define generalized Macdonald polynomials. In a joint work with L. Cassia and A. Stoyan, we extend some of the well-known formulas obtained for ordinary Macdonald polynomials to their higher level counterpart. In particular, we propose a generalization of the formula relating Macdonald polynomials to Whittaker vectors obtained by Garsia, Haiman and Tesler. The talk will start with a brief introduction to the notions of Whittaker vectors and reproducing kernels using a toy model. Then, I will introduce Macdonald polynomials and their generalization, and present our main results. I will conclude with a discussion on possible applications to the (q,t)-deformed integrable hierarchies recently introduced with A. Garbali.</p>

               <p>Penrose limit provides a promising avenue to the stringy regime of the AdS/CFT holography, giving rise to the pp-wave background. We propose a probability interpretation of the Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase (BMN) two-point functions in free N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory in terms of the dual tensionless strings in the infinite curvature limit. If our proposal is correct, it would not only provide the first examples of systematic calculations of the norms of higher genus critical superstring amplitudes, but may also in principle gives exact complete results for any string coupling, due to the convergence of genus expansion. We further provide a definition of the entropy of these BMN strings in the presence of an observer, and derive an entropy bound. Finally, we compare with thermal entropy in Calabi-Yau quantum systems and discuss a possible cosmological application.</p>

              <p>
                The super Macdonald polynomials generalize the Macdonald polynomials to the super space with the Grassmann coordinates \(\theta_i\).
                They form a basis of a level zero representation of the quantum toroidal algebra of type \(\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}\).
                The Pieri rule of the super Macdonald polynomials is obtained from the action of the raising operators of the algebra.
                We show the relation of the Pieri coefficients to the Nekrasov factor for the instanton counting on the blow-up of \(\mathbb{C}^2\).<br />
                The talk is based on a collaboration with R.Ohkawa and J.Shiraishi.

              <p>Since the discovery of 3d/3d correspondence, three-manifolds are noticed to be a powerful tool to construct 3d N=2 gauge theories, in parallel to Calabi-Yau manifolds. However, both are not completely established yet. In this talk, we focus on the three-manifold approach, which itself also has two parallel methods. One is the surgery of three-manifolds, found by Gadde, Gukov, and Putrov in paper “Fivebranes and 4-manifolds”. Another one is the double branched cover, found by Cecotti, Córdova, and Vafa in “Braids, walls, and mirrors”. In this talk, by using mathematical ideas, we try to complete and unify these two methods. </p>

              <p>
                The ODE/IM correspondence is the relation between the spectral analysis of ordinary differential equations and the functional relation approach to two-dimensional quantum integrable models.
                In this talk, I will consider the relation between the linear-differential system associated with an affine Toda field theory based on an affine Lie algebra \(\hat{g}\) and two-dimensional conformal field theory with W-algebra symmetry for its Langlands dual \(\hat{g}^{\vee}\). We calculate the WKB periods for the ODE, which are shown to correspond to the classical conserved currents of the Drinfeld-Sokolov integrable hierarchies. They are shown to agree with the quantum integrable motions of the conformal field theories with W-algebra symmetry. This correspondence provides an exact parameter relation bewteen ODE and IM and a better way of computing of higher integrals of motion in CFT.

               <p>
                 We compute the correlation function between a circular half-BPS Wilson loop (or straight Wilson line) and a local operator in ABJM theory utilizing its M-theory description.
                 The local operator can be a 1/3-BPS single-trace chiral primary operator or the stress-energy tensor.
                 Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, these correlators are dual to fluctuations of a probe M2-brane in \( AdS_4 \times S^7/Z_k \).
                 We derive analytic results for both cases and compare them with existing results based on supersymmetric localization in the literature.
                 In the large-N limit with k finite, our holograkphic results exhibit perfect agreement with localization.
                 This talk is based on work done with Xiao-Yi Zhang and Yunfeng Jiang.

             <p>
              We argue that the space of invariants of multi-matrix model quantum mechanics, at finite \(N\), is generated by a set of invariants, naturally divided into two distinct classes: primary and secondary. The primary invariants act freely, while secondary invariants satisfy quadratic relations. We argue that the primary invariants correspond to perturbative degrees of freedom, whereas the secondary invariants emerge as non-trivial background structures. The number of primary invariants for a model with d matrices is given by \(1+(d-1)N^2\). The number of secondary invariants grows as \(e^{cN^2}\) at large \(N\), with \(c\) a constant. Finally, we identify a class of light single-trace operators that behave like free creation operators at low energy but saturate beyond a critical excitation level, ceasing to generate new states. This leads to a dramatic truncation of the high-energy spectrum of the emergent theory. The resulting number of independent degrees of freedom is far smaller than naïve semiclassical expectations, providing a concrete mechanism for how nonperturbative constraints shape the ultraviolet behaviour of emergent theories.

             <p>In a joint work to appear with Yalong Cao, Andrei Okounkov, and Zijun Zhou, we introduce stable envelopes in critical cohomology and K-theory for symmetric quiver varieties with potentials and related geometries. For tripled quivers with canonical cubic potentials, critical stable envelopes reproduce those on Nakajima quiver varieties, constructed by Maulik and Okounkov. Using the critical stable envelopes, we can construct solutions to Yang-Baxter equations with R-matrixes acting on the critical cohomologies of symmetric quiver varieties with potentials. Then, the FRT formalism gives natural (shifted) (super) Yangian action on these critical cohomologies.</p>
