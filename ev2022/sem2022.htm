The Yangian is found on the interface engineered by a stack of n fivebranes (D5 or NS5), which is related to the inhomogeneous sl_n spin chain.

BPS structures refer to the data of the DT invariants together with their wall-crossing structure. On the same Calabi-Yau geometry another set of invariants are the Gromov-Witten (GW) invariants. These are organized in the GW potential, which is an asymptotic series in a formal parameter and can be obtained from topological string theory. A further asymptotic series in two parameters is obtained from refined topological string theory which contains the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) limit when one of the two parameters is sent to zero. I will discuss in the case of the resolved conifold how all these asymptotic series lead to difference equations which admit analytic solutions in the expansion parameters. A detailed study of Borel resummation allows one to identify these solutions as Borel sums in a distinguished region in parameter space. The Stokes jumps between different Borel sums encode the BPS invariants of the underlying geometry and are captured in turn by another set of difference equations. I will further show how the Borel analysis of the NS limit connects to the exact WKB study of quantum curves.

Certain classes of supersymmetric two-charge black hole microstates are described by supergravity solutions containing shockwaves, that are horizonless and smooth away from the shockwave. These configurations have been used to describe how black hole microstates absorb and scramble perturbations. In this paper we construct the first family of asymptotically flat supersymmetric three-charge microstate solutions that contain shockwaves. We identify a family of holographically dual states of the D1-D5 CFT and show that these pass a set of tests, including a precision holographic test. We find precise agreement between gravity and CFT. Our results may prove useful for constructing more general families of black hole microstate solutions.</br>                </p>              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="semDates">November ﻿2﻿nd (Wed), 17:00-18:00              </td>              <td class="semName">A﻿l﻿b﻿a﻿ ﻿G﻿r﻿a﻿s﻿s﻿i ( CERN & University of Geneva, Switzerland)              </td>              <td class="semTitle">Holographic thermal correlators from supersymmetric instantons              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="semAbst" colspan="3">                <p>                  <u>Abstract</u>                  <br>I will present an exact formula for the thermal scalar two-point function in four-dimensional holographic conformal field theories.

At large spin the instanton expansion of the thermal two-point function directly maps to the light-cone bootstrap analysis of the heavy-light four-point function.

Then I will explain a remarkable algebraic structure in the bootstrap crossing equations and its fundamental role in bootstrap studies. I will show that the bootstrap bounds are nearly saturated by conformal QED3 after introducing assumptions relevant to conformal QED3. In particular the CFT data of four flavor QED3 can be isolated into a closed region and the bootstrap bounds are beautifully consistent with some large Nf perturbative results. The bootstrap results suggest the critical flavor number of QED3 is slightly above 2 while below 4.

We classify the conformal line operators along an arbitrary smooth path as well as the spectrum of conformal dimensions and transverse spins of their boundary operators at finite 't Hooft coupling. These line operators are shown to satisfy first-order chiral evolution equations, in which a smooth variation of the path is given by a factorized product of two line operators. We argue that this equation together with the spectrum of boundary operators are sufficient to uniquely determine the expectation values of these operators. We demonstrate this by bootstrapping the two-point function of the displacement operator on a straight line.

The defining property of the systems is that they have unitary time evolution, therefore they are good quantum mechanical models, and they also have a unitary evolution operator which translates them along the space direction. These unique properties make them exactly solvable. The models can show integrable and chaotic behaviour as well.

The first one regards explicitly supersymmetric TTbar deformations of N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Written in terms of Noether currents associated with translations in superspace, these deformations are on-shell equivalent to the dimensionally reduced supercurrent-squared deformations of 2d N=(0,1) and N=(1,1) theories, respectively. In the N=1 case, two forms of the deformation driving the same flow are presented. Another tale is on TTbar deforming the 1d dual to the 2d BF formulation of JT gravity, where fundamental observables are Wilson lines and loops. After interpreting this deformation as a modification of the BF theory boundary condition, we study the deformed correlators of boundary-anchored Wilson lines in the 3d Chern-Simons lift of BF theory. Analogous correlators in BF theory per se are also calculated below the Hagedorn temperature, where the SL(2,R) principal series dominates over the discrete series.

Surprisingly however, analogous studies in (massive) integrable theories have been lacking. In this talk, I will fill this gap by presenting a systematic study of crosscap states in integrable field theories and spin chains. First, I derive an exact formula for overlaps between the crosscap state and any excited state in integrable field theories with diagonal scattering. Using the formula, I compute the crosscap entropy i.e. the overlap with the ground state in several examples, and find that it decreases monotonically along the renormalization group flow except in cases where the discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken in the infrared. We next introduce crosscap states in integrable spin chains and obtain exact determinant expressions for overlaps with energy eigenstates. These states are long-range entangled and provide interesting initial conditions for the quantum quench protocol, which are quite distinct from short-range entangled states corresponding to the boundary states.</br>                </p>              </td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td class="semDates">May 31st (Tue), 16:00-17:00              </td>              <td class="semName">Yang Zhou (Fudan University)              </td>              <td class="semTitle">Partial Reduction and Black Hole Information              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="semAbst" colspan="3">                <p>                  <u>Abstract</u>                  <br>Black hole information paradox is a well known problem and significant progress was made recently.

We show that such marginal deformations are equivalent to TsT transformations of the background geometry.

It plays an essential role in resolving the black hole information paradox. However, existing calculable models of entanglement islands are mainly in two dimensional toy models of quantum gravity for which there are no local graviton modes. In order to search for entanglement island and study its properties in higher dimensions, we will use the Karch-Randall braneworld. This theory is doubly holographic and we can perform explicit calculations locating the entanglement islands using holography. We will formulate a version of the black hole information paradox in the Karch-Randall braneworld and see how entanglement island helps us to resolve this paradox. Our calculation is performed in a simple case of Karch-Randall braneworld and it is purely analytic. Interestingly, the gravitational theory localized on the Karch-Randall brane is massive and this is due to the fact that the brane is coupled to a bath which violates the energy-momentum conservation on the brane and the mass of the graviton is therefore a one-loop quantum effect. Based on this observation, we will formulate a conjecture that entanglement islands exist only in massive gravity theories. If time is allowed we will briefly discuss our further study of this conjecture and the proof of it in a large class of spacetimes including asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes.</br>                </p>              </td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td class="semDates">May 10th (Tue), 15:30-16:30              </td>              <td class="semName">Vincent Caudrelier (University of Leeds)              </td>              <td class="semTitle">Classical Yang-Baxter equation, Lagrangian multiforms and ultralocal integrable hierarchies (<a href="Caudrelier.pdf">slides</a>)              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="semAbst" colspan="3">                <p>                  <u>Abstract</u>                  <br>The notion of integrability for classical (field) theories has been almost entirely studied from the Hamiltonian point of view since the early days of the modern theory of integrable systems. In 2009, the notion of Lagrangian multiform was first put forward by Lobb and Nijhoff as a purely Lagrangian framework to capture integrability. The main idea is to formulate a generalised variational principle for an action involving a certain differential form whose coefficients are interpreted as Lagrangians for a hierarchy. Since its proposal, this idea has flourished in various directions and I will review the main developments for classical field theories in 1+1 dimensions.</br><br>Two key ingredients are the multiform Euler-Lagrange equations and the so-called closure relation, both of which derive from the generalised variational principle. In this talk, I will present the connection between Lagrangian multiform theory and the well-established theory of the classical r-matrix which had a purely Hamiltonian interpretation so far. I will explain how the classical Yang-Baxter equation underpins the fundamental properties of a certain Lagrangian multiform and the corresponding zero curvature equations. A large variety of known hierarchies are contained as special cases, such as the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur hierarchy, the sine-Gordon (sG) hierarchy and various hierarchies related to Zakharov-Mikhailov type models which contain the Faddeev-Reshetikhin (FR) model and recently introduced deformed sigma/Gross-Neveu models as particular cases.</br><br>Time permitting, I will also illustrate the versatility of our method by showing how to construct new examples of integrable field theories and their hierarchies by coupling integrable hierarchies together. We provide two examples: the coupling of the nonlinear Schrödinger system to the FR model and the coupling of sG with the anisotropic FR model.</br><br>This most recent results are based on the joint work arXiv:2201.08286 with M.

It combines the Makeenko-Migdal loop equations, with the cut-off L on maximal length of loops, and the positivity conditions on certain correlation matrices. Our algorithm is inspired by the pioneering paper of P.Anderson and M.Kruczenski but it is significantly more efficient, as it takes into account the symmetries of the lattice theory and uses the relaxation procedure in the line with our previous work on matrix bootstrap. We thus obtain the rigorous upper and lower bounds on plaquette average at various couplings and dimensions. The results are quickly improving with the increase of cutoff L. For D=4 and L=16, the lower bound data appear to be close to the Monte Carlo data in the strong coupling phase and the upper bound data in the weak coupling phase reproduce well the 3-loop perturbation theory. We attempt to extract the information about the gluon condensate from this data. Our results suggest that this bootstrap approach can provide a tangible alternative to, so far uncontested, Monte Carlo approach.  I will also mention our results on the bootstrap approach for an unsolvable two-matrix model in the  large N limit.

Black holes should correspond to ensembles of states in the boundary field theory. By performing a careful analysis of the superconformal index of 4d N=4 SU(N) Super-Yang-Mills theory, with the help of a Bethe Ansatz type formula that I will review, we are able to exactly reproduce the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of BPS black holes in AdS5 x S5. The large N limit exhibits many competing contributions, that we are able to identify with complex saddles of the (putative) gravitational path-integral. Along the way we propose a necessary condition for complex saddles to contribute, based on the size of their non-perturbative corrections. Such a prescription reproduces the field theory analysis.

The near-BPS theories can be obtained by reducing N = 4 SYM on a three-sphere and integrating out the fields that become non-dynamical in the limits.  I will present various subsectors including PSU(1,1|2) and SU(1,2|2) types of subsectors in this limit. We finally analyse the symmetry structure of the sectors in view of an interpretation of the interactions in terms of fundamental blocks. This is based on two publications: 2012.08532 and 2111.10149, and one work in progress.</br>                </p>              </td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td class="semDates">March 15th (Tue), 14:00-15:00              </td>              <td class="semName">Ye Yuan (Zhejiang University)              </td>              <td class="semTitle">Graviton Scattering in AdS at Two Loops (<a href="Ye-Yuan.pdf">slides</a>)              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="semAbst" colspan="3">                <p>                  <u>Abstract</u>                  <br>I will present a preliminary result on the third-order correction in 1/N expansion to the four-point correlator of the stress tensor multiplet in N=4 super Yang--Mills theory at large 't Hooft coupling, which corresponds to the two-loop scattering of four gravitons in the dual AdS5×S5 supergravity.

Physically they capture instantons in six-dimensional gauge theories with the most general intersecting codimention-two supersymmetric defects. We study the properties of the moduli space of tetrahedron instantons. We compute the instanton partition function, which lies between the higher-rank Donaldson-Thomas invariants and the partition function of the magnificent four model. Remarkably the instanton partition function has a closed-form expression in terms of the plethystic exponential, and matches the index of M-theory on a Calabi-Yau fivefold. Our computations provide an equivariant test of the duality between M-theory and type IIA string theory.</br>                </p>              </td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td class="semDates">January 11th (Tue), 15:00-16:00              </td>              <td class="semName">Carlos Nunez (Swansea)              </td>              <td class="semTitle">SCFTS in 3d, 4d, 5d and Some of Its Applications (<a href="Nunez.pdf">slides</a>)              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="semAbst" colspan="3">                <p>                  <u>Abstract</u>                  <br>In this seminar I will discuss the content of the papers I presented in the year 2021. The main message is a method to write holographic duals to super-conformal field theories in dimensions D=1,2,3,4,5,6. Various checks of the dualities will be presented and some recent predictions will be discussed. I will try to make the material accessible to graduate students, postdocs and faculty, not necessarily working on these topics. There is a final part more directed to the string theorists working on these themes.</br>                </p>              </td>          </tr>          <tr>              <td class="semDates">Jan 5 (Wed), 14:00-15:00              </td>              <td class="semName">Gang Yang (ITP-CAS)              </td>              <td class="semTitle">Color-kinematics duality and double-copy of form factors              </td>            </tr>            <tr>              <td class="semAbst" colspan="3">                <p>                  <u>Abstract</u>                  <br>Recent studies of scattering amplitudes reveal an intrigue duality between color and kinematics. This color-kinematics (CK) duality also indicates a deep connection between gauge and gravity theories via the so-called double copy. In this talk, I will first give an introduction to the CK duality and the double-copy picture, then I will discuss some new progress on the high-loop CK-dual solutions and the double-copy prescription for form factors.                </p>              </td>          </tr>          <!--  -->          </tbody>        </table>      </div>      <!-- seminar-list -->      </div> </div></body></html
