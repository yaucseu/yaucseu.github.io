In this talk, we will introduce our recent work on unraveling the hyperfine structure by rigorously decomposing Rényi contour into the contributions from particle-number cumulants. We show that the hyperfine structure, introduced as a quantum-information concept, has several properties, such as additivity, normalization, symmetry, and unitary invariance. To extract the underlying physics of the hyperfine structure, we numerically study lattice fermion models with mass gap, critical point, and Fermi surface, and observe that different behaviors appear in the contributions from higher-order particle-number cumulants. We also identify exotic scaling behaviors in the case of mass gap with nontrivial topology, signaling the existence of topological edge states. In conformal field theory (CFT), we derive the dominant hyperfine structure of both Rényi entropy and refined Rényi entropy. By employing the AdS3/CFT2 correspondence, we find that the refined Rényi contour can be holographically obtained by slicing the bulk extremal surfaces. The extremal surfaces extend outside the entanglement wedge of the corresponding extremal surface for entanglement entropy, which provides a new tool to probe the hyperfine structure of the subregion-subregion duality in the entanglement wedge reconstruction.    </p>  </td></tr><tr>  <td class="semDates">    Nov. 21st (Tue), 16:00-17:00  </td>  <td class="semName">    João Penedones (EPFL, Switzerland)  </td>  <td class="semTitle">    Bootstrapping the a-anomaly in 4d QFTs  </td></tr><tr>  <td class="semAbst" colspan="3">    <p>      <u>Abstract</u><br>      The space of 4d quantum field theories (QFTs) can be thought of as the Renormalization Group flows between Conformal Field Theories (CFTs).

The generalization to theories with four supercharges, in the non-Abelian case, has not been understood so far. In this talk, based on work in progress with Riccardo Comi and Sara Pasquetti, we focus on brane setups with NS and D5’ branes, proposing that the related quiver gauge theories involve ‘generalized bifundamentals’, that is strongly coupled qft’s which are ancestors of the well known T[SU(N)] theories. Our proposal leads to 3d mirror dualities that can be exactly proven, reducing them to known Seiberg-like dualities. This gives strong support to the proposal.

These theories emerge from the geometric engineering of M-theory on toric Calabi-Yau threefolds. While their BPS spectrum is typically wild, with an infinite number of states of arbitrarily high spin, specific algebraic solutions of the integrable systems indicate the existence of tame chambers, associated with gauge theory phases. In these chambers, the BPS spectrum can be expressed in closed form and comprises vector multiplets, infinite towers of hypermultiplets, and Kaluza-Klein states. By utilizing wall-crossing formulas, it becomes possible to obtain the spectrum in any other chamber. To illustrate this methodology, I will examine the concrete example of local del Pezzo threefolds, geometrically engineering SU(2) Super Yang-Mills with matter, and their corresponding q-Painleve' cluster integrable system. Additionally, time permitting, I will briefly discuss the interpretation of the aforementioned results through the lens of WKB approximation for q-difference equations.    </p>  </td></tr><tr>  <td class="semDates">    Oct. 10th  (Tue), 16:00-17:00  </td>  <td class="semName">    Benjamin Basso　(ENS Paris, France)  </td>  <td class="semTitle">    Wilson Loop Duality and OPE for Super Form Factors of Half-BPS Operators (<a href="BenjaminBasso.pdf">slides</a>)  </td></tr><tr>  <td class="semAbst" colspan="3">    <p>      <u>Abstract</u><br>      We propose a dual Wilson loop description for the MHV super form factors of half-BPS operators in planar N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory. In this description, the local operators are represented by on-shell states, made out of zero-momentum particles, that are absorbed by a null periodic super Wilson loop. We present evidence for this duality at weak coupling, by performing an explicit calculation of the Wilson loop matrix elements through one loop. At tree level, the interactions localize at the cusps of the loop, revealing a simple connection between the super form factors and the m = 2 tree amplituhedron. At loop level, we show that the Wilson loop calculation reproduces the known results for the super form factors. Inspired by this duality, we extend the OPE program developed for the form factors of the Lagrangian to the super form factors of the higher-charge operators. We introduce non-perturbative axioms and conjectures for the main building blocks that govern the exchange of the lightest flux-tube excitations. These blocks appear as simple refinements of the form factor transitions introduced in earlier OPE studies. They are expressed at any value of the ’t Hooft coupling in terms of the tilted Beisert-Eden-Staudacher kernel. We carry out checks of our conjectures up to two loops at weak coupling for three- and four-point form factors of half-BPS operators of various lengths, finding perfect agreement with perturbative data.    </p>  </td></tr><tr>  <td class="semDates">    Sep. 26th  (Tue), 16:00-17:00  </td>  <td class="semName">    João Caetano　(CERN, Switzerland)  </td>  <td class="semTitle">    Large Charge 't Hooft Limit of N = 4 Super Yang-Mills (<a href="JoaoCaetano.pdf">slides</a>)  </td></tr><tr>  <td class="semAbst" colspan="3">    <p>      <u>Abstract</u><br>      In this talk, I will show that the large charge sector of the SU(2) N=4 SYM provides a solvable corner of the theory which exhibits striking similarities with the standard planar limit.

The symmetries become manifest under the equivalence between the partition functions and the quantization problem of one-dimensional curves (Fermi gas formalism), where the symmetries are the coordinate transformations of the associated curves.

I will describe the first applications of this idea in the case of the line defect CFT living on a supersymmetric Wilson line in the 4D gauge theory.

Hopefully, these results can soon be confirmed, or disproved, by using the recently constructed TBA for AdS3.    </p>  </td></tr><tr>  <td class="semDates">    Apr. 4th (Tue), 16:00-17:00  </td>  <td class="semName">    Lakshya Bhardwaj (University of Oxford, UK)  </td>  <td class="semTitle">    Discrete Relationship of Generalized and Mirror Symmetries  </td></tr><tr>  <td class="semAbst" colspan="3">    <p>      <u>Abstract</u><br>      The study of generalized global symmetries is related to the presence/absence of discrete structures in quantum field theory, e.g. the presence/absence of discrete gauge fields in the theory. In light of this, it is natural to ask if such discrete structures play a role in the celebrated examples of 3d N=4 mirror symmetry. That is, whether the believed 3d N=4 mirror pairs are precisely dual to each other, or rather they are dual only if one mods out extra coupled TQFTs. In this talk, I will discuss a series of recent papers with Mathew Bullimore, Andrea Ferrari, and Sakura Schafer-Nameki, where we probed this problem in a variety of ways, which involved understanding global forms of Higgs branch and (IR enhanced) Coulomb branch symmetries, 1-form symmetries, and ‘t Hooft anomalies of these symmetries. We found all this information matched exactly across mirror pairs involving unitary and special unitary gauge groups, meaning that no discrete modification of mirror symmetry is needed in all these cases! This may be good or bad news, depending on one’s taste; however, in the process we uncovered fundamental conceptual relationships between the study of generalized global symmetries and anomalies on one hand, and the study of various types of monopole operators and associated monopole formulas on the other hand. Another application of our methods is the deduction of generalized symmetries and anomalies of higher-dimensional SCFTs using their magnetic quivers.

The set of observables that we construct includes the entanglement wedge cross section and four extra half geodesics' lengths. We try to study the properties of these observables in Hamiltonian formalism, including the system's evolutions generated by these observables and the brackets between these observables. We use two methods to study these questions, by Brown-York tensor’s bracket in covariant phase space formalism and by canonical formalism, which give consistent results.With the two methods, we get several interesting results related to these questions. We find that these observables may generate a novel behavior in the system's evolutions, which include a split somewhere on the Cauchy surface. We compute the brackets between these observables, and the only non-zero ones are the brackets between the entanglement wedge cross section and the half geodesics. Taking use of these brackets in the context of entanglement wedge cross section, we also construct a slightly different geodesic network where all of the geodesics' lengths commute with each other.    </p>  </td></tr><tr>  <td class="semDates">    Mar. 7th (Tue), 14:00-15:00 (offline)  </td>  <td class="semName">    Wen-li Yang  (杨文力) (Institute of Modern Physics, Northwest University)  </td>  <td class="semTitle">    Off-diagonal Bethe ansatz approach to quantum integrable models  </td></tr><tr>  <td class="semAbst" colspan="3">    <p>      <u>Abstract</u><br>      Applying the recently developed method—the off-diagonal Bethe ansatz method, we construct the exact solutions of the Heisenberg spin chain with various boundary conditions.

At fixed N and k, each element of Hom(Zk,E8) defines a different SCFT. The SCFTs are connected by Higgs branch RG flows. We determine the full hierarchy of these RG flows for any value of N and k. The hierarchy takes the form of an intricate Hasse diagram: each node represents an IR orbi-instanton (homomorphism), and each edge an allowed flow, compatibly with the 6d a-theorem. The partial order is defined via quiver subtraction of the 3d magnetic quivers associated with the 6d SCFTs.    </p>  </td></tr>          <!--  -->          </tbody>        </table>      </div>      <!-- seminar-list -->      </div> </div></body></html
